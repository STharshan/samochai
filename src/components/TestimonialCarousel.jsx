    text: `Lovely little spot! Straight off the bat, the gentleman behind the counter welcomed us with a big smile. Drinks are lovely, from the warming chai latte through to smooth karak coffee. Breakfast omelette was also a great choice. Briefly speaking to the owner, you can tell they care about the customer service and the best ingredients. Only downside is that I am not more local to this business, otherwise I‚Äôd certainly be back again. Cheers guys!`,

    text: `Lovely home brewed karak chai, nothing from a sachet. Samosa's handmade, full of flavour, not too spicy. Good quality, clean and great prices. What more can you ask for? Our experience was 10 out of 10, plus 10, minus nothing ! üòÅ`,

Can recommend the mango and passionfruit twist, chicken burger, samosas, sheesh pita and white choc cookie. Will be back for more!!!!`,

    text: `The food was finger licking good, was drooling for seconds. I had the omelette wrap with beef rashers and extra masala. It was out of this world. I also had the sheekh egg roll, I have to admit both were absolutely delicious with the intricacy of spices and oomph to it. But the milkshake, I loved it, sends nostalgic vibes through memory lane. The first sip to the last, it was everlasting, I didn‚Äôt want it to end. Taking in to consideration, I‚Äôve tried it for the first time. I will definitely come back again BUT I need to try the rest of the menu too.`,
